### üîç Performance Issue: Lighthouse Score at 40

The low Lighthouse performance score is due to using externally hosted images from **Figma**, stored on **Amazon S3**. These images are not optimized, leading to:

- **Large file sizes**, increasing load times.
- **External server latency**, slowing image delivery.
- **Lack of modern formats** like **WebP** for efficient rendering.
- **No caching**, forcing repeated downloads.
